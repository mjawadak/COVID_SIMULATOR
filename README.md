# An Agent Based Simulation Framework for Epidemic Modeling of Infectious diseases such as COVID-19

The novel COVID-19 virus has disrupted human life across the globe. In a few months, it has spread throughout the world affecting every country on this planet. Efficient monitoring and prediction of the spread can allow the worldâ€™s governing bodies to take necessary steps on time to minimize the impact of such diseases. Predicting the spread of infectious diseases is challenging. A conventional approach of modeling such diseases relies on building models on the entire population level, e.g., the SIR and the SEIR models. However, a challenge with the application of these models is the unavailability of the initial parameters such as the rate of spread and recovery. Considering these challenges, in this paper, we take a bottom-up approach and build an agent level simulation framework that models an urban environment along with the mobility of the individuals to predict how the virus spreads for a given geographical region. Our framework provides predictions for the impact of an infectious disease in a given urban environment. On top of that, we can also perform what-if analyses to compare the impact of the disease under different scenarios, e.g., predicting the impact with and without interventions.
