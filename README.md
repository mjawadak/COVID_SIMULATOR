# An Agent Based Simulation Framework for Epidemic Modeling of Infectious diseases such as COVID-19

The novel COVID-19 virus has disrupted human life across the globe. In a few months, it has spread throughout the world affecting every country on this planet. Efficient monitoring and prediction of the spread can allow the worldâ€™s governing bodies to take necessary steps on time to minimize the impact of such diseases. Predicting the spread of infectious diseases is challenging. A conventional approach of modeling such diseases relies on building models on the entire population level, e.g., the SIR and the SEIR models. However, a challenge with the application of these models is the unavailability of the initial parameters such as the rate of spread and recovery. Considering these challenges, in this paper, we take a bottom-up approach and build an agent level simulation framework that models an urban environment along with the mobility of the individuals to predict how the virus spreads for a given geographical region. Our framework provides predictions for the impact of an infectious disease in a given urban environment. On top of that, we can also perform what-if analyses to compare the impact of the disease under different scenarios, e.g., predicting the impact with and without interventions.

## Code for the models:

The mobility model: transition_probabilities_simple.csv

The infectiousness model: infectiousnessModel.py

The recovery model: DeathPredictionModel.py

The spatial model parameters can be configured in the config.json file


## Parameters:

The config.json file contains the parameters for the simulation.

Example file:

{
  "parameters": {
    "NUM_SCHOOLS":3000,
    "NUM_RESIDENCES":3560000,
    "NUM_RETAILS":43000,
    "NUM_WORKPLACES":1100000,
    "POPULATION":8910000,
    "SCALE_FACTOR":1000,
    "INTERVENTION_INFO": {
      "flag": true,
      "locked_entities":["school","employment","retail"],
      "threshold_infected":1000
    }
  }
}

The parameter SCALE_FACTOR is simply used to scale down the number of entites. For example, the actual the NUM_SCHOOLS = NUM_SCHOOLS/SCALE_FACTOR.

INTERVENTION_INFO provides the information about the entites to be locked down. The parameter "flag" is used to enforce the lockdown or not. If true, the framework will implement a lockdown once the active cases exceeds the value given by "threshold_infected" and the entities to be locked is provided by "locked_entities".


## Dependencies:

Numpy

Pandas

Scikit-Learn
